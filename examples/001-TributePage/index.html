              <h2>Biography</h2>
              <p>
                Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who
                developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of
                modern physics. His work is also known for its influence on the
                philosophy of science.
              </p>
              <p>
                Einstein is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E
                = mc<sup>2</sup>, which has been called the world's most famous
                equation. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his
                services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his
                discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."
